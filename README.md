### Recommendations
We recommend when starting a kickstart for plays in the US, Louise should focus on having a set goal around $5000 since on average those were the more successful kickstarts. We also recommend starting the kickstart around the May-June time of the year since, based upon the data, these were the kickstarts that were the most successful. If Louise were to start it later in the year there would be a higher chance of the kickstart failing and not reaching it goal.
